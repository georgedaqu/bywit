					<p>I have over 20 years of experience working with internationally successful companies like Scania, Boliden, SCA/Essity and Autoliv/Veoneer. This has given me a strong knowledge of different industries, markets, positions and insight from working with people from different cultural backgrounds. Independent of industry, size or geography all great businesses have one thing in common; You need great people to succeed.</p>
					<p>Great people are not necessary overachievers with the best education. To me great people are and remain curious. They want to learn from others and to understand better. They want to innovate and develop, to try new things and new ways and to learn from different cultures.  Meeting all these fantastic and curious entrepreneurs on a daily basis is truly living my dream. Our shared knowledge and curiosity to learn from each other will help us create tomorrow’s most successful companies.</p>

					<strong>&quot;The mental game behind successful execution is the biggest challenge.&quot;</strong>
					<span>Nalle Söderström</span>
				</h3>
				<div class="team_desc">
					<p>New York, 2007. I was about to start Mediaplanet from scratch in one of the most competitive markets in the world. I thought I knew exactly what to do and how to do it. What became my biggest challenge was to handle the constant stream of small failures and success. Keeping the drive, the focus and hope for me personally, for a newly recruited organisation, my family and every one else was a daunting task.</p>
					<p>Starting a new business is like a twelve round boxing match where you face a new fighter in every round. Failures and setbacks will give you new opportunities, new chances to succeed. We became cash flow positive within a year, we quickly grew revenue and we opened six offices in North America, and me and my family ended up staying in the U.S. for ten years.</p>
					<p>What I admire most about entrepreneurs, isn’t their ability to come up with great ideas, but the mental strength and tenacity to execute them. It is a mental game that requires exceptional strength. In order to succeed you must learn to fail successfully.</p>

					<strong>&quot;Just do it&quot;</strong>
					<span>Elias Jacobson</span>
				</h3>
				<div class="team_desc">
					<p>I grew up working on our family farm. In the beginning I was watching, studying and learning what the older farmers were doing. When I was old enough my father and his foreman let me try different tasks on my own. They started by showing us, then supervising us and teaching us what was important or dangerous. Eventually I knew the farm and the work by heart, finding my own ways to improve on it.</p>
					<p>I apply the same philosophy to our portfolio companies. We know how to help companies in an early stage take the next step. We know what is important and the dangers when you scale a company. A young company will not get the help they need from a couple of hours with an industrial advisor. Discussing IPR and next round strategies is not enough.</p>
					<p>From my experience a company needs someone to just do it, so they can see, learn and experience what the next step is all about.</p>
					<p>Working this way gives me a sense of fulfilment, helping others take the next step and grow, in what becomes our common journey.</p>
					<p>Then and now; 16 investments, two IPO:s end three +100 MEUR companies later...</p>

				<div class="team_desc">
					<p>I am a banker. I have to admit it. I love numbers and I know the financial markets.  But my passion has always been entrepreneurship.  Meeting with and talking to successful entrepreneurs, discussing business models and development opportunities is what makes my job fun.</p>
					<p>I find myself in the middle and I get enormous satisfaction in being able to translate between entrepreneurs and financiers. When these two worlds meet it gets really exciting.</p>
					<p>Many entrepreneurs spend too much time chasing cash, keeping investors happy or trying to secure the next round of financing. This contributes close to nothing when it comes to developing the business, often in a critical phase where every hour of the day, every sales call or R&D meeting can make a difference.</p>
					<p>As an investor, WiT does not invest and disappear, hoping for success and a possible future equity round at a higher valuation. We are in this together with the entrepreneurs. We love to share responsibilities and work loads, making sure that we use all resources where they are most needed and set a long-term financing plan. Every journey will have its ups and downs and working through it together we can secure a strong partnership and reduce stress. We are fully committed to every investment and only by rolling up our sleeves can we secure a higher success rate.</p>

					<p>Something magical happens when you connect the right people with the right idea. I have dedicated a great deal of my life and career in search of these innovative ideas. Through my work I have been able to help turn good ideas into great ones. This happens when you find the right partners and the right investors.</p>
					<p>I have helped facilitate big deals and worked with fund raising activities on an international level. I have also played an active part in post-investment activities aimed at supporting new businesses by providing base investment and entering non-domestic markets. I have experience working with Fraser, MTG, Bonnier, SEAF, META Group and RNB.</p>
					<p>With a long experience I have developed my own set of specialities: Investments, ICT, IT and related industries, transportation, green technology, sustainable innovations, open innovations, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding. My work with WiT allows me to do what I really love; to use my skills to help grow businesses and ideas.</p>
